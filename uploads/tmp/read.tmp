Is interdisciplinary learning important to you? Why or why not?

Absolutely! This type of learning makes it so I absorb the ideas taught much easier. I also believe that I retain the ideas if I can relate them to numerous things. 

Absolutely, i know feel responsible for my education and the benefits are extraordinary. 

Absolutely, I love to have subjects connected to each other, so they can be understood collaboratively. 

Absolutely, it offers a larger arena of education that includes multiple viewpoints. 

Absolutely, my interests are so rhizomatic and varied that I would feel constricted were I not privy to such a sundry education 

Absolutely. When subject areas are compartmentalized, the application of the material seems to be lost in the "game of school." 

Absolutely. I greatly value my ability to approach an issue from many different angles and through many lenses. I believe this is because of my interdisciplinary educational experience at TESC. 

Absolutely. I think dissecting things into particular disciplines enforces the ideas that things are separate instead of interconnected. 

Absolutely. Interdisciplinary learning has given me a more objective (and well rounded) perspective in my specific field of interest and in my life as a whole. 

Absolutely. Nothing in this world actually fits into little boxes. Viewing the world with the knowledge that all our organization of information is human-made is an important skill and Evergreen teaches that through interdisciplinary learning far better than a school with divided subjects ever could. 

Absolutely. Only by connecting various fields of knowledge through study and understanding can the real answer be found. 

"Absolutely: that is the reason I am here. It isn't just an education; interdisciplinary learning shows you how to apply your education to a life you are genuinely interested in leading. "

Anything that de-institutionalizes the learning process improves it. Introducing variety of any kind into a classroom enhances it (mostly). 

At most times, yes. 

Because I got to study and focus on what I want and interested in. 

Because I seek the answers to my intellectual and emotional questions heuristically, which means I have to follow a living, historical path that includes all disciplines. It would be completely artificial to limit my learning to any subset of disciplines. 

Because it integrates with how I perceive, experience and process life. 

Because it is important. 

Because it makes what you are doing real and relateable. 

"Because that's the way life is. "

"Conceptually, yes. As one taking evening/weekend courses, however, it doesn't presently apply. "

"Definitely; interdisciplinary learning illustrates the connectivity of subjects far better than traditional learning. Aside from that, I've learned about a lot of interesting things from disciplines I probably wouldn't have taken a course in at a traditional institution. "

For me, I love having my natural science based programs, which are ecology-oriented, blended with social science courses that give me a background in public policy, economics, and statistics. The interdisciplinary approach has been a big asset to me personally. 

"From my experience last year, it was very important. I couldn't have allowed my project to flourish and be in lectures and workshops as a full-time student. "

I am not sure what that is exactly. 

I am not sure, it makes the courses more interesting but my credits seem worthless if I wanted to transfer, or if wanted to focus on one area in particular in a class. 

I believe all forms of learning are important. 

I believe interdisciplinary learning is essential for growth and gaining newfound knowledge. It matures and nutures one with great wisdom and the desire to achieve and appreciate more in the long run. 

"I came back to college to learn the things that the real world wouldn't teach me, almost all of these things are the interdisciplinary classes that I despised the first time through college. "

I came to TESC because it was the college available to me and because I was lied to by the "recruiters" as were the others who attended. Most of who have since left the program 

"I didn't think it was until I got here. I think it's really important to approach education -- at least for me -- the way Evergreen does. I love programs and am really excited to do a contract in the summer. Making connections is important in learning rather than simply memorizing and regurgitating. "

"I don't know if it's important, but I certainly think it's a good way to learn. "

"I don't know. "

I feel that interdisciplinary learning allows much more freedom to explore interests than a traditional major. It seems that programs can give a broad focus and interests can be deeply examined through contracts. 

I find interdisciplinary learning important because it permits students to put context to their learning. 

I find interdisciplinary learning is rich with diversity and integration. 

I firmly believe interdisciplinary learning is essential, however, I believe the work and course-load being offered by the Tacoma Program are ridiculously easy and uninformative. There are junior high and high school students attending our program and laughing. There is more than enough reading and nothing to connect it to the idea of the program (i.e. Lyceum). Prof. Bacho and Dr. Katz are the only two instructors that regularly return corrected work with comments that apply to material and not simply their own random personal opinions/preferences. 

I have no strong feelings either way. 

i learn more 

"I like having a broad range of ideas coalesce into one program. However, it is frustrating that I can't take a basic acting or literature course. I also get frustrated that, in order to add a language, I have to go to 20 credits. Finally, I think it is hard to get serious grounding in a subject and that is what grad schools look for. "

I like it because it fits my life style and personality. I feel I learned more from peoples experiences and keeping sociable has helped with networking. 

"I like the approach, though at times some relatively irrelevant concepts get through and take up too much time, so I'd say that there's good and bad sides to that. "

I look at interdisciplinary as the learning of new skills. Taking new ideas from others and learning from others.Discipline of looking inward to learn who you are and how you can add to the learning process. 

I prefer it, but wish more realistic classes were offered. 

I think interdisciplinary learning can be helpful at times, but it often can dilute certain fields of study and be counterproductive. 

I think interdisciplinary learning is good because it causes students to be exposed to subjects they may not otherwise have pursued but the most important thing to me is having the freedom and flexibility to study what I want, how I want. 

"I think interdisciplinary learning is great to an extent. When I started out at Evergreen, I found the interdisciplinary courses to be stimulating. I found interests in areas I didn't expect. But, as I progress at Evergreen, I truly appreciate being able to hone in on my exact interest. I would feel I was wasting my time if I were in an interdisciplinary course at this point. "

I think interdisciplinary learning is important because it allows for real world situations where more than one focus must be dealt with. I also enjoy participating in interdisciplinary learning because I feel it gives me a well rounded background and education. 

I think interdisciplinary learning is very important, but I\'m worried that too many times that approach is handled in the wrong way... adding lots of "fluff" aspects of multiple disciplines instead of focusing on real worthwhile skills and information. 

I think it is important because I would like to study interdiscilinary learning. 

I think it is relevent, however i do not like the full time prograns at all. 

I think it is very important as I like incorporating more then one disipline in my learning. Such as in Science and philosophy. 

I think it is very important for me because I can learn a lot of things which I want to learn. 

I think it makes for a more well rounded person. 

"I think it's great because I feel like I'm at part of the process versus just a container storing all this knowledge. What I'm learning here helps me to truly be the individual I want to be not cookie-cutter. "

"I think so. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. "

"I think so? So far it hasn't made very much sense, but if done well it could be crucial to becoming a renaissance man! "

I think specialization is against our nature as social, tribal, community-minded beings. We are not living as fully functional members of communities when we are too specialized. In contrast, interdisciplinary knowledge of many subjects and skills allows us to be connected to one another and the greater good, which is hopefully part of our future as humans. 

"I think that it is good if done well. I think that in some cases it does not work as well. A seminar on the IPCC report is an example that doesn't really work. "

"I would like to be able to focus more (zoom in) on the area I am interested in and TESC's policies are preventing me from doing that! "

I would not say it is important to me, it can work out well, and seems great on paper. Although, I have found in practice, it can really get you stuck in something that you have no interest in, in another setup, a student could have a wide array of varying classes that may all be of interest to that person, but not necessarily tied together with a common theme. 

"I wouldn't say important; however the approach is more engaging. I enjoy taking methodologies and language from multiple disciplines to examine an issue or topic. "

"I'm evening and weekend. Interdisciplinary doesn't really seem to apply. "

"I'm not totally sure what that is. "

In my case it is, as Biology and teaching are two different things and I need to know about both of them. 

Incredibly. The mind naturally works to connect concepts we associate in one area to many other areas. This is supports the very nature of our brain function and thus provides greater opportunities for learning. 

Interdisciplenary learning is important to me because without variety everything (especially academics) has a tendency to get stagnant. 

Interdisciplianary learning is important to me because it makes learning applicable and relevant . I find it easier to apply my learning to real life situation when I have been taught them in context 

interdisciplinary is important to because I am interested in many things and it is fun to see how my different interests are connected and be able to study them together. 

"Interdisciplinary learning comprehensively ties learning together so that you come to understand how subject matter can be used in a realistic manner. It's pretty cool! "

Interdisciplinary learning has been the greatest experience I have had in my time at TESC. Without it, I would never have made some of the insightful connections that were possible between [seemingly] unrelated studies and texts. 

"Interdisciplinary learning has not been entirely effective for me at Evergreen, but the paths I've taken since moving on to independent study have been greatly influenced by the programs I was a part of my freshman year. "

Interdisciplinary learning is essential for my own experience at Evergreen. I feel that without the integrated scopes of focus on a myriad of topics, that my learning experience would be very empty and vague. I fully appreciate the collaborative atmosphere here, in which students and teachers all retain and are able to relate their varying interests, strengths, and weaknesses in a very concrete and fulfilling way. 

"Interdisciplinary learning is important as long as it doesn't interfere with the overall focus of a program. "

Interdisciplinary learning is important because it incorporate the many components that impact a subject. It\'s what I call "Big Picture Learning". 

Interdisciplinary learning is important to me because I feel it is the most realistic. In order for me to feel informed and make positive change in the world I must have a holistic view of the topic. With a life cycle understanding of the systems in place I can work to make the particular system or concept more sustainable. 

Interdisciplinary learning is important to me because it allows me to look at one subject from many perspectives and lends diversity to a program. 

Interdisciplinary learning is important to me because it provides a way to bridge many concepts and show how they are connected. Such as politics and literature, two things that one may not think have much connections, at Evergreen we are shown that they do. This provides us the opportunity to believe we can have careers that are broader than one monontous career. 

Interdisciplinary learning is important to me because of my interests, like literature and philosophy are not as separated as I might have first thought when beginning. I believe studying both, and many other disciplines like philology, for example, help to elucidate my areas of interest, and give me a broader and deeper understanding of contexts and meanings. 

Interdisciplinary learning is not totally important to me. While I have enjoyed learning my class subjects in a multiple dimension form, my field of work requires me to have more specialized mental health classes. 

Interdisciplinary learning is something that I am still getting used to. It is an interesting method, and seems to be more effective at teaching critical thinking than traditional schooling styles. 

"interdisciplinary learning is the reason that i am at evergreen. students don't realize that life IS interdisciplinary, and most graduates don't know how to apply what they learn to anything else. "

"Interdisciplinary learning is very important for me. I've always been very competitive, and I enjoy challenging myself in Evergreen courses. "

Interdisciplinary learning is very important to me because I am not a student who learns through pure memorization. Creating connections between different ideas helps me understand both more fully. Even when I took more conventional classes at other schools I found parrallels between the courses and my learning was enabled by those connections. 

"Interdisciplinary learning is very important to me because it's something I need to work on. Later in life no one is going to be there to hold your hand. It's important to be independent and to push yourself as much as you can. "

Interdisciplinary learning is very important to me!! I think it provides a rounded education and one that is needed to be an active involved person in todays world. It helps connect to ideas not only in the classroom but also once outside school it helps one connect larger issues to personal relations as well as drawing on multiple aspects of knowledge which creates a deeper understanding. 

Interdisciplinary learning is very important to me. An analogy I like to use to explain this is: Imagine you spent an hour each day strengthening a single muscle in your arm. After having strengthened all of the muscles in your arm, you then try to go about doing difficult tasks which involve many muscles in your arm. You would find you were unable to do may of these tasks, because while you had worked and strengthened many different areas of your arm, these areas have not be strengthened in relation to each other. In the same way, without experiencing first hand how one subject relates to another in an interdisciplinary setting, you can not be sure you will be able to effectively apply your education in a productive manner. 

Interdisciplinary learning is very important to me. Examining a topic from several different aspects is interesting and makes me care more about the topic. 

Interdisciplinary learning is why I am at Evergreen. I feel with the program I am in I have been able to explore topics in greater depth and for complete understandings based on the model that provides me with faculty that is contributing the whole of my learning experience. It also has given me more freedom to tailor my experience to my interests and needs and I feel I am getting and giving so much more than the traditional learning environment ever afforded me. 

Interdisciplinary learning is wonderful when the disciplines are sharply defined and the synthesis is clear - when a class descends into frenzy over debate about capitalism and gender studies, regardless of the educational content the class was originally positing, it is frustrating when a professor does not bring the focus back to the subjects we are paying to learn about. 

Interdisciplinary learning sounds nice on paper, but my experience with it has not been entirely positive. To emphasize "interdisciplinary" my program has students spend a good amount of time each week in workshops instead of lectures. Many students are simply not motivated to do any work during this time. There is no system to hold anyone accountable to actually doing anything during workshops. Each week I get to spend what could be valuable time listening to my cohorts talk about movies, video-games and anything other than the material we\'re supposed to be collaboratively learning. I only get to seriously work through the material we\'ve been given for workshop later in the week - when I am alone or with my own study group. Furthermore, I deeply wish that I could study music - just a few credits per quarter, but I am studying science and the 16 credit interdisciplinary programs make this nearly impossible. I would jump at the opportunity to dump the "interdisciplinary" components of my program (such as workshop and seminar) to undertake serious study in other fields. I feel that I am missing out on something really valuable - a longtime dream of being able to study music composition in college. There is simply no way to take a serious science program alongside a few elective credits (unless one is willing to take more than sixteen credits). This is very unfortunate. On the other hand, it is a great idea for professors to synchronize lectures in different fields such as chemistry, biology in a complementary fashion. Undoubtedly there is benefit to this. 

Interdisciplinary study is important because it helps me to think about my focus of study from other perspectives, learn to negotiate with other peoples strengths and weaknesses and apply my talents to a wide purview of disciplines. 

"Interdisciplinary study is one of the corner stones of the Evergreen State College and it should be continued in the future. It's one of the reasons I picked this school. "

It allows me to select the courses that are necessary to me and offer several disciplines concurrently. More comprehensive learning, to me. 

It helps me to stay focused 

It is an important part of my journey as I get the opportunity to see how all of the disciplines may connect and will lead you towards your long term goal. 

It is an interesting concept that I have not gotten to experience this year. 

It is but I think the school needs to diversify its different areas of studies through conventional classes as well as programs. In order to give students that opportunity to fine tune their majors and studies. As well as giving undergrads the confidence to apply to graduate schools and upper level programs within the TESC catalog. That is truly the one thing I think evergreen lacks is not enough classes. Perhaps more half time interdisciplinary programs accompanied by classes. I think this would give students all the advantages of both worlds. I also think evergreen would benifit from a sustainability studies planning unit. 

It is essential to learning. 

It is if the professors are able to stay focused on the purpose and not get sidetracked. That was my largest problem with the programs... teachers seemed to easily get off subject. 

It is important for me to consider how many subjects affect my field of study and how I can examine many topics through the lens of health and medicine. 

It is important so that we can understand a subject from multiple different aspects. 

It is important to me because I feel that it is necessary to see how different fields interact with one another, especially in a field like psychology where many other fields may come into play when discussing various psychological problems. 

It is important to me because I learn differently then any one else does. Being able to incorporate the concepts and ideas that are important to me and my life are the best things about Evergreen. 

It is important to me to get a full grasp of something, not just one view. For example I love the Culture, Text and Language way that you get history, art, literature, and all the subtext of that time or place from it. 

"It is important to me, because life isn't just one subject. They all intermingle and coexist with one another. It's important to have at least a basic understanding of anything you can to be able to gain success in any form. "

It is important, because I appreciate and value the concept of being a good generalist. 

It is important, because it makes me feel more valued as an individual student. I feel that I can study what inspires me the most and have my work noticed as education. 

It is important, it gives me insights further then might be provided in a program designed with only a career goal in mind. 

It is now that I have experienced it first hand. The downside is that the things that the professor is most interested in overlaps all other displinaries. This is either good or bad, depending on mutual interests between students and professors. 

It is particularly in the field of science so that you have multiple ways to approach questions. 

It is somewhat important because it is really nice to have everything be related, which also makes material easier to understand. 

It is very important to me because i think that with interdisciplinary learning you get more knowledge in more fields then you would if traditional learning. 

It is very important. It allows me to see the connections between subjects that I probably would not have made otherwise. When I attended Washington State University in the summer of 2007 I had a great experience. But then I came to Evergreen and saw the weaknesses of how traditional schools, like WSU, teach in separate classes. Evergreen, on the other hand, teaches every subject at once and allows you to understand how things work together a lot more clearly. 

"It is very important. It is why I came to Evergreen. DON'T CHANGE THAT! "

"It is, because I believe that most studies are connected to each other somehow, and drawing lines of division hinders progress. That said, I feel that Evergreen isn't really as interdisciplinary as it claims to be, and all to often I see students completing their degree having only studied a very narrow range of subjects. "

It is, because it is the very essence of Evergreen. 

It is, but only there has to be a main focus and not just a bunch of hodgepodge. 

it is. I believe that regardless of your major, you should have a firm grounding in all fields of knowledge. You never know when it might be useful, and it is certainly useful to have more knowledge as opposed to less. 

"It is. It makes sure people are learning practical things that give them experience for the future instead of them completing assignments that don't teach them anything just so they can get a bit of text on their resume so they can get a job working in a dark office the rest of their lives. "

"It is; it is a means of presenting material to be learned in a manner that makes that material make sense in other contexts beyond class. It would be much less sensible to study subjects in isolation from each other, which I have done at other schools. Whether one is able to make connections between subjects or not, in a non-interdisciplinary setting it doesn't matter. At Evergreen those connections are the most important part of a student's learning. "

It provides for more well-rounded studies. 

"It teaches me how to alternate my behavior and position in a class, especially when I am with peers of very different/divergent views. It encourages me to see connection in the world I live in that I wouldn't normally. "

It was a new experience for me. I enjoyed it and definitely understood the intent behind the seemingly unrelated topics 

It was its benefits, but the single discipline classes are also valuable. It is good having both options. 

"It was very important for me at first and now it's only moderately important. This is because I'm starting to specialize and that makes it increasingly difficult to find programs at Evergreen that involve interdisciplinary exploration of subjects that are all relevant to what I most want to learn. "

"It's a good idea but it wont save Evergreen. "

"It's important because without it people are too focused and specialized, what they learn lacks adequate context in the world. "

"It's important but it tends to force students to study generalizations of both subjects instead of allowing them to intently focus on one subject they'd prefer. "

"It's quite important, because it teaches us how to expand our brains around other subjects concerning the main subject, though it is very hard to do! "

"Its the future of education. Subject-independent learning doesn't make sense when compared to the benefits of interdisciplinarian approaches. "

"It's very important for me because to write you have to have a life. If my only focus was writing I would have any other experiences or knowledge to feed me as a writer. "

Kind of 

Makes everything come together in a cohesive whole 

more enriching experience overall 

no 

"No - I'd rather be able to concentrate on one thing, and learn it well. "

"No because I already know what I want to take from this school and I'm wasting my time on extra stuff. "

"no, I don't find it very helpful "

No, I have enjoyed this year but miss taking one subject classes as well. 

No. Some interdisciplinary course work is good, but to do this every quarter decreases the number of courses you can take in your focus area. 

No. I think it takes attention away from what I need to focus on. 

"Not especially in the sense that I would like to be able to take other courses along with the one I'm already in with art doing Evening and Weekend. "

Not important. In the world of multi-tasking, this manner of learning is beneficial. 

not really because i dont feel that the interdisciplinary options apply to me. For example there is not other area of coordinated studies that has gone with animal science programs 

"Not really, don't know enough about it. "

"Not really, I can make the connections between subjects without having them taught to me through interdisciplinary learning. I feel the program system at Evergreen provides students with the only option of taking a class a few faculty want to teach, rather than taking subjects they want to take. I, for example am interested in the arts, and literary theory. However, since I can only take one program a quarter, and there weren't any programs that catered to what I wanted to learn or night/weekend classes I was interested in taking I feel like I've wasted an entire year learning about something I'm not entirely interested in. "

Not really, organized classes and competent faculty are more important to me than interesting class titles. 

Not really, though I am not against it. Studying events in high levels of detail, reading a book that is 600 pages about Afganistan and the CIA, for example, is very important as well. The details can give a level of understanding that ID study cannot in myu opinion. 

Not really. Because I like singe disciplinary learning aswell. 

not really--I have a specific area of focus 

Not sure 

Not, actually. I\'m older and want to focus more now. I came to Evergreen more to "do my own thing" than for the interdisciplinary offerings. 

Of course, it is why I came to Evergreen. Segregated discplines promotes continual linear approaches to problems in society. 

Of course. Especially since I am seeking to be a teacher. It is very important I can look at a subject from a variety of angles. 

Of course. You need to have a broad choice of material to learn from, and know about different learning styles as an educated, well-rounded individual. 

Only a little. While it ties many things together it also seems to divide the focus of some classes. 

Only if it truly covers topics that I want to learn 

promotes critical thinking keeps me continuously challenging myself and my ideology/beliefs 

"Skagit Valley College, where I earned an Associate of Arts degree, emphasized interdisciplinary learning. I learned early on that this method of learning is best for me. I'm interested in how different fields interact or how to apply the ideas of one field the problems or issues of another field. "

"Sometimes. Sometimes I feel like I just want to study what I'm most interested in. "

Somewhat. I like to expand my knowledge, but I finally, at 55, have a focus in my life and want to concentrate on it. 

sure 

The emphasis placed upon integrating learning across disciplines allows for a greater practical application of skills. Additionally, the learning experience has a greater "real World" application. 

"The option is nice- I don't know that I use it. "

There is no other kind of learning. 

This is the first time I have been involved in interdisciplinay learning and enjoy it very much. 

"To some extent. I really like the program concept because it is easier for me to have one main course or thing to focus on then to have a bunch of unrelated courses at the same time. I like that the programs are interdisciplinary, but I think that they are too much so. It's hard to find a class that looks perfect, because they are so interdisciplinary that there are aspects of each program I wouldn't normally be interested in. "

Very important because it will prepare me in working with others in my career field. Plus, every kind of learning is important to me. 

Very important if done right. 

Very important to me. 

Very important to me. Was the foremost determining factor in attending Evergreen. 

"Very important, I don't need to explain myself, it explains itself. "

Very important, vitally important.Critics dialogue between fields and allows for learning that is not tapped inside a box. Creates free and empowered thinking 

Very important. I like to understand why something is important from many different perspectives. I believe interdisciplinary learning helps students see how everything is connected somehow and that bridging the gap between different ways of seeing things can be made more possible with this learning style. 

Very important. We neeed to pull back from super specialization to a more integrated experience of understanding and knowledge. 

very much - the real world and its problems are all interconnected 

"Very much so, it's the only way to avoid learning in a vaccuum, which is inaccurate in the extreme. "

Very much so. It creates a broader, more useful knowledge base to use in the real world. 

"Very! Disciplines don't exist in vacuums, they overlap. It's limiting to study one thing in isolation. "

"VERY!!! Allows me to see the 'big picture' as well as how othe topics relate to my area of study. "

"Very, Evergreen is one of those schools that allows you to lean as little or as much as you choose. If you want to satisfy a passion for knowledge and growth, you're possibilities here are endless. If you want to screw around and under-appreciate your own capabilities and what the school has to offer, you might graduate, but you won't make it much further because you didn't learn a thing. "

very, it is a great tool for a well rounded education, and also can be helpful in revealing subject you may not know you are interested in. 

Very, It is essential to have more than a narrow understanding of the world or a subject. 

Very. Many different subjects interconnect and this connection is important and cannot be ignored. Interdisciplinary learning covers all areas of a subject. 

Very; I think in pictures and concepts. Therefore the interdisciplinary approach allows me to see more of the big picture and draw more relevant connections. 

"Very--the more connections I'm able to make in my brain, the better I retain the information and the more I can contextualize it within my lived experiences. "

what is interdisciplinary learning? 

what is that? 

What? 

Yeah, it really shows me how my studies are connected to other students in other programs and really makes aware the lines where I could work with others to find a solution. It gives a more comprehensive learning style. 

Yes 

Yes

Yes 

Yes 

yes 

Yes 

Yes - it gives me the opportunity to think outside the box and to learn in that type of environment. 

Yes -- it makes balancing courseloads easier as well as having the benefits of studying many aspects of a subject. 

Yes - it offers real world experience and ability to put into practice our learning that will be inherent to our lives beyond Evergreen 

"YES - It's the only way to receive a WELL rounded indepth education "

Yes - to me it is the only way to learn. As all fields of knowledge are interrelated, it makes sense to study them as such. Interdisciplinary programs allow one to focus on specific subjects (macroeconomics, for example) without losing sight of the bigger picture. 

Yes and No. In some ways I feel it to be very beneficial. In others, I feel it is too easy to lose focus on a subject. 

Yes because by combining subjects into themes I feel as though the material is much more applicable to everyday life. 

"Yes because I am able to learn from different areas that at first may not seem to be related, yet each area fits into a category and it's part of the bigger picture. "

yes because i can learn on my own. 

Yes because I feel I am responsible for my learning. 

Yes because I feel interdisciplinary learning makes my education more well-rounded and applicable to my everyday life. I\'m not compartmentalizing my academic pursuits into "classes" or "majors". I don\'t like to isolate what I learn in the classroom from what I learn outside of the classroom and I believe interdisciplinary learning helps blur those lines. 

Yes because I like to make connections between disciplines. It has enriched my overall learning experience. 

"Yes because I think it's important to learn things that you didn't intend on learning. "

yes because interdisciplinary learning is important to me because life is not a closed system everything affects everything else. 

Yes because it allows me to learn a lot about a single subject. 

Yes because it allows me to pull from multiple angles to gain understanding. 

Yes because it allows me to study something from many different angles and in a learning based way. 

Yes because it approaches learning of material in a real world context rather than forcing you to learn something just so you can test well on it. 

Yes because it gives two different aspects to the same subject which brodens the subject matter. All of this helps you to think outside of the box. 

"yes because it gives you a chance to view things in a different way even if you wouldn't have taken a class on a certain topic. "

Yes because it helps me learn more about what I am trying to learn 

yes because it helps me learn the material. 

Yes because it helps me make connections between different areas of study. 

Yes because it is important to learn about a subject in respect to a larger picture as a connection with other things. 

yes because it is only practical because most things have to do with other things so studying two things at the same time will help you understand a concept or theory better. 

Yes because it provides a base to learn from. 

Yes because it requires a depth and breadth of thought not used in focused learning 

Yes because nothing is mutually exclusive. 

yes because the programs are structures to coordinate a variety of classes under one central focus, so it all is relevant and applicable 

Yes because the world cannot be organized into departmental boxes. 

yes because they effect everyone around us. 

Yes because to me learning is a personal process and I am able to learn the way it works for me. 

yes because you received both perspectives of a subject 

yes becuase it shows how we all connect 

Yes but only when it truly exsists. I feel that one perspective narrows your understanding of a topic or issue and learning to switch your lenses to look at certain topics and issues will give you a broader perspective and more insight into the problem and possible solutions. 

yes but the opportunity to focus on your subject specifically is equally valuable 

yes I don;t really feel liek going into it though 

Yes- I have difficulty forming connections-this helps push me to do so. 

yes i learn more from my fellow students 

Yes I think interdisciplinary learning is a good way to learn because it helps engender a deeper understanding of the subject. 

yes I think that it is very important, although I think that now that I am a junior I need to be filling particular requirements for graduate school which does narrow my focus a lot. 

"Yes I think the connection between ideas make the ideas more relevant and engaging than if the subjects stand seperately and it also encourages students and teachers to become more well rounded people as often you must participate in a subject you normally wouldn't have explored. "

"Yes I'll explain later. "

Yes in moderation, interdisciplinary brodens horizons. 

Yes interdisciplinary learning is important to me because it helps to tie what you may be learning to the outside world and exposes one to a variety of opinions as well as points of view. 

yes Intergration helps the learning experience 

"Yes is is very important to me. Transferring from a traditional four year school has allowed me to experience the two and I have fallen in love with Evergreen's learning environment. "

Yes it allowed for a broaden sense of insight. 

Yes it allows me to engage and interact with my peers and faculty with the same interest or ideas. All bringing a different perspective or shedding new light upon one another. 

Yes it has made some of the more traditional courses that I have taken such as Molecule to Organism and Introduction to natural sciences more rewarding when the professors coordinate subject matter so that ah ha! moments occur simultaneously. 

Yes- it helped me explore lots of different areas of study prior to choosing one to pursue. 

yes it helps make the material interesting and relevant to the real world 

Yes it is an intresting approach that gives a well rounded academic learning environment. 

Yes it is becausee, in our highly interconnected world, it is important to be able to see those connections and look at how they are interacting. Interdisciplinary studies have given me a unique opportunity to investigate some of those connections and I have discovered far more then I would have if I had continued to pursue a single major. 

"Yes it is important to me, but I think it is overrated at Evergreen. There are some classes (as opposed to programs) that would be difficult to teach appropriately in an interdisciplinary context, such as organic chem, calc, stats, etc., that wwould be incredibly useful when applying for grad school, but are difficult to work into my schedule with a 16 credit program. I'd like to see 12 credit programs with more 4-6 credit classes available. "

Yes it is very important because too often fields are treated like they are completely self contained and exert no influence on one another 

Yes it is, because it keeps my attention focused and avoids alot of mundane crap. 

Yes it is, it just more relaxed, and made to fit the individual, instead of structured learning which fits no individual 

Yes it is. Traditional learning is not an option with my life, family and commuting. 

Yes it is. I feel like interdisciplinary learning helps with more evolved college education. 

Yes it is. I think it is important, specifically on a campus that does not require blocks of certain subjects to be taken. I feel that it increases the relivancy of the Evergreen Degree in the outside world by forcing everyone to still have the basics in all areas. 

yes it really brings to focus why learning any one thing is important. 

"yes somewhat - as books can't replace on the job training. "

yes very! Until we learn to grasp the plurality of the situation and issues we are all working on and until we are willing to us an inter sectional analysis to develop solutions we will not make significant sustainable progress 

YES! 

yes! 

Yes! because I am able to study the subject matter from many different perspectives. I also have a more unbiased understanding of the suject matter. 

Yes! becoming to focused on any one topic blinds you to the related topics surrounding it. 

Yes! Everything in life is connected. A broad understanding of many different subject areas allows a person to be more dynamic and creative in their life. 

Yes! In the world, things are not seperated by subject, it is best to learn in as natural a way as possible. 

Yes! Interdischplinary learning reflects the real world around me socially and in the work place. 

Yes! It makes sense to not separate learning from life in the education system. 

yes! nothing in the real world that you would have to deal with is cut and dried in one discipline, everything is interrelated. 

yes! this style of learning makes more sense to me and offers one the ability to obtain a more well-rounded education, in my opinion. 

Yes! You learn how everything is connected. You find uses for what you are learning in class. 

Yes, 

Yes, all ways 

Yes, as life is not only one thing but multidimentional and diverse. 

Yes, as long as it is structured well 

Yes, at my level 

yes, b/c it reflects the interconnected nature of reality 

Yes, because all of the hard sciences feed into each other. To be able to address interdisciplinary topics and issues in incredibly valuable in this realm. 

Yes, because divisions between different subjects sometimes removes meaning and context from what is being taught. 

Yes, because I appreciate the knowledge and experience coming from two different perspectives. 

"Yes, because I can integrate my interests with the plans of the instructor's. "

yes, because I gain a deeper understanding, and more rounded learning. 

Yes, because I know myself well enough that I know I can keep up with the work. 

Yes, because I like learning more than one subject at once. 

Yes, because in my field sytemic collaboration is very important to produce effective changes. 

Yes, because in the natural world everything is connected and has an influence on each other and this style of learning accommodates that. 

yes, because it allows be to learn a lot more about a subject or field 

Yes, because it allows for a greater range of context to learning. 

Yes, because it allows for a much more effective synthesis of information, and leads to a better understanding in all subjects. Also, this allows room for much more personal exploration, research in areas that a person is specifically interested in. 

Yes, because it allows me the opportunity to learn what I want and gives me the chance to take everything possible out of the experience. 

"yes, because it allows me to explore fields I might not otherwise take classes in, and makes direct connections to areas I'm already interested in. "

Yes, because it allows me to learn more about things and have a better understanding of them because of interdisciplinary learning. 

Yes, because it allows me to sample more then one field of study at once. 

Yes, because it allows the student to develop understanding through a diverse outlook. 

Yes, because it draws several fields of interest together for me and thus I learn more. 

Yes, because it enabled me to learn not only about my area of interest but others as well. 

Yes, because it gives me a chance to study what I want. 

yes, because it gives the individual freedom to choose what he/she wants to study AND helps to mature and grow with people that share similar interests and values. 

Yes, because it has enhanced my learning experience. 

"Yes, because it is important to make connections among different fields. Rarely is a person just interested in one field, but we are often forced to concentrate on one so that our skills are more marketable. This makes a person less flexible and is detrimental. HOWEVER, I don't think that Evergreen succeeds in this area. I have never taken an interdisciplinary program that felt well blended. The professors are rarely good at combining their knowledge, and it usually just feels like two programs in one. "

"Yes, because it makes connections between different fields easier to see, but not to the point that it's hard to find basic courses to experiment in. "

YES, because it prepares me more for life outside of school, which is not segmented and organized neatly by subject. Integrated education is more interesting because I can relate to it, because life is "integrated education". 

Yes, because it provides application for the learning process. 

Yes, because it shows how all of the subjects are really connected to one another. It is much better then learning seperately about math and history. Interdisiplinary learning is much more like real life as well. 

Yes, because it shows how the many views are incorporated into a whole. 

"Yes, because I've been able to get closer to coursework that relates to my primary academic interests. "

Yes, because my program is "one thing" I can focus on. 

Yes, because no issue has one facet. Wholistic education is important because it broadens the mind to consider multiple perspectives of the same subject. 

Yes, because no subject is all that isolated, so much overlaps from other areas, and plays into a comprehensive understanding of the whole. For instance I came here to study filmmaking, I had no idea just how many fields were involved. I feel confident taking a career in anything involved in a production. 

Yes, because study of many different subjects helps me to understand other areas of focus better. 

"Yes, because the world doesn't work in segments. My goal is to work for an international aid organization and to do so I will need to be able to work cooperatively with people from other fields and disciplines and understand where our experiences intersect. Interdisciplinary learning prepares me to look at an issue or problem from a multitude of different angles, something I feel will be very useful to me in the future. "

yes, becuase it integrates ones thinking across typical divisions 

"yes, but at evergreen, i feel like my choices are even more limited then at a normal traditional college. Evergreen really doesn't seem to offer interdisciplinary courses, the are actually quite specific and centered on one thing. "

"yes, but I don't feel like there is enough REAL science. (labs, chemistry, etc...) "

"yes, but i haven't been interested in the programs offered lately, and so haven't taken one in over a year. "

yes, but learning what I came to learn is more important. 

Yes, but so is "straight" learning. I would like certain classes to be non-interdiscilpinary though. For example I am very intersted in film, photography, music, but mediaworks fall 2008 has an interdisciplinary environmental slant to it which I am not interested in. This was pretty frusterating because there is no straight media class for me to take and that would have been my first choice. 

"Yes, but sometimes it is too much in 16 credits because you can be forced to do one aspect that you really dislike because it's sandwiched in with 14 credit's worth of amazingness. "

"yes, can't study anything in isolation; need a broader perspective "

"Yes, especially in the program format. I feel like Im able to learn a lot of things I wouldn't be able to at a conventional college and I also get a better understanding of how different fields relate. "

"Yes, even in night classes I've found lots that has overlapped-learning works best when you can make connections from one erea of study to another. Real life isn't seperated into subjects, so why should the classroom be? "

Yes, Evergreen was my first choice of schools for specifically this reason. 

Yes, extremely so. A varied perspective on one area has open my eyes and created a true systems way of analyzing a subject and making informed decisions and perspectives that take into account multiple disciplines. 

"Yes, extremely, my focus is very interdisciplinary, and there is VERY little support of upper division interdisciplinary work. I had a project that combined geography, ecology, and astronomy, and no professors had the time or willingness to sponsor my project. This was because of 2 reasons: there is more support and a lower student teacher ratio for Freshman students, and they didn't feel individually that they could give credit outside of their specialty. "

Yes, extremely. In middle and high school, I was always the one to bug the teacher about real-world application. I couldn\'t stand feeling like I was memorizing information to pass a test. A sense of connectedness with the material makes an objectively heavy workload manageable or even enjoyable; when I don\'t care about the narrow topic at hand, I don\'t care about the work related to it. My fall/winter program delivered the former. Now that I\'m feeling less connected to the mountain of work we have, I\'ve fallen back into the old game of figuring out how to give the teacher what he wants, rather than figuring out how to learn. That\'s why I marked "too heavy" for the workload. 

"yes, extremely. it's why i came to evergreen. especially when studying biology, because chemistry, microbiology, genetics ect are so interrelated. trying to study these subjects isolated from one another means not understanding each of them fully. "

Yes, for me it is a more realistic way of learning. 

Yes, getting a perspective is important. 

Yes, going back to school after 20 years is hard. 

"Yes, holistic education is very important. One cannot remove an area of study out of its context, or all one's learning will be removed from the context of our society and our world. Interdisciplinary learning allows the student to connect cause and effect. For example, agricultural policies are not only related to the land and ecology, but also to the political economy and culture of different peoples. "

Yes, however I worry that I will not be able to cover as many fields of study as I could in smaller courses. Because of this I try to mix evening and weekend courses with programs. Also, I have been disappointed with the lack of African based programs, especially African history. 

Yes, I am not successful, or interested in the traditional model. 

"Yes, I attended Western Washington University for a year and I came to appreciate Evergreen's style a lot more. There were times at Western I felt like I was only reading half of the assigned books. I took a class called intro to mideival literature. All of the books we read were about the upper classes role in society and the books documented the collapse of the french nobility over the course of centuries. We didn't even discuss that aspect. We just talked about literary devices and it was horrible. "

Yes, I believe it creates an environment that provides the broadest educational oppertunity. 

Yes, I believe it gives a broader perspective. 

Yes, I believe it is a less stressful and more efficient schooling process for me. 

yes, i believe it makes you a more rounded person. 

Yes, I believe that it is important (especially in my field) to examine social problems and solutions from various perspectives. 

"Yes, I can get a well rounded education. It's also nice that my teachers can communicate. "

yes, i can make better connections and be more focused on what i am interested in 

Yes, I can study what I want and connect many subjects through interdisciplinary contracts. 

Yes, I enjoy learning in an interdisciplinary environment. 

Yes, I enjoy spending time and creating relationship with teachers and students. I enjoy learning several topics that are related to eachother, it just makes more sense. 

yes, I feel I can learn more and have better projects in the end 

Yes, I feel it can bring a real life connection to the subject matter being taught and aids in understanding. 

"Yes, I feel it's important to have a broad and yet focused scope in my discipline while not being limited to traditional focuses that are hightlighted in other universities. "

"Yes, I feel it's important to take on your education with more than just signing up for class. "

Yes, I feel more well rounded and like I can apply my learning to real life. 

Yes, I feel my education has been full of things which connect me to everything 

yes, I feel that it develops skills that are needed outside of academic settings 

yes, I feel the dynamic created with interdisiplinary studies to be very potent as compaired with single subject learning 

Yes, I feel this improves overall retention. 

Yes, I feel you learn a whole lot more about the subjects when in an interdisciplinary program than a stand-alone class. To see the interaction between disciplines creates a more real world learning experience. 

Yes, I find it important because I feel I am getting a more complete understanding of the subjects I have studied. 

yes, i have more that one interests 

Yes, I have multi-perspective education, and like the contact with new students. 

Yes, I like being able to study a range of topics and see the connections between them. 

Yes, I like learning many things stemming from one subject. 

Yes, I like the independence at Evergreen 

Yes, I like to be exposed to various areas of studies so that I can learn in a way that will allow me to see the connections between many different subject. 

Yes, I like to find connectedness in all of my studies. The interdisciplinary learning seems to facilitate this. 

Yes, I really enjoy learning more than just one thing and relating everything back to my core. 

Yes, I really have enjoyed receiving different areas of learning throughout the year. 

Yes, I think I think I can take away a lot more from my education. The context in which we are learning the material is more applicable. 

Yes, I think it is important to be able to look at the world in different perspectives. 

yes, I think it is necessary to engage yourself with several forms of language or communication, may it be expressing yourself visually, speaking a foreign language, or using a literary voice, i feel it is necessary to surround your focus of study with other challenging elements. 

Yes, I think it\'s great practice for finding that aspects of your life and the world around you can enrich one another- Discovering connections/differentiating and drawing similarities between"separate" subject or ideas helps make sense of life and our position in the world. 

"Yes, I think it's important to get a balanced perspective on every topic studied. "

"Yes, I think it's important to have a well rounded education. "

"Yes, I think it's important to learn about the different facets and nuances of any subject. "

Yes, I think the interdisciplinary learning helps students to "think on their feet" 

Yes, I value a diverse perspectives of the subjects I have chosen to study. 

Yes, I want to be able to learn things and find new interests by accident through interdisciplinary programs. 

Yes, I want to be able to understand the importance and relevance of the communities and traditions I live amongst. Also being aware of all fields (of study or concern) gives me the ability to transfer knowledge and ideas. 

"Yes, I was not a big fan of grades because I don't think it shows how well you are doing or understand something. "

"Yes, I'm especially interested in interdisciplinary literature, because in order to understand most literature, you must be aware of all the issues that go into said literature, be they historical, social, psychological, etc. "

Yes, in my previous school the teacher focused on one main objective. At evergreen, looking at different perspectives is I feel broadening my awareness. 

Yes, interconnected worldview which is necessary for problem solving ad integration. 

Yes, interdiciplinary learning is important because it balances education. 

Yes, interdisciplinary learning allows students to understand how the social, cultural, political, economic, etc. systems of our country/world all work together. It provides students with the opportunity to get a "big picture" education. 

Yes, interdisciplinary learning broadens perspective and allows your brain to expand and absorb more knowledge. 

"yes, interdisciplinary learning is crucial to developing 'true' understanding. no field stands alone, completely by itself. "

Yes, interdisciplinary learning is important because as a prospective law student it is good to know how various discplines can relate to one another. 

Yes, interdisciplinary learning is important to me because it allows me to explore the other subjects that I may or not be interested in. 

Yes, interdisciplinary learning is important to me because it represents the interdisciplinary world in which I live. Very little in my life can be broken down into a single heading. Why should my classes? 

Yes, interdisciplinary learning is important to me. I do not think that it is possible to have as rich or as complex of a perspective on something if you are limited to only one epistemological framework. 

"Yes, interdisciplinary learning is very important to me. Making connections between fields of study makes what we learn real. In life, biology, sociology, and literature aren't divided, for example. They don't function independently in our lives and learning about fields together shed light on information we, as students, traditionally wouldn't be subject to; in this aspect Evergreen education are the most valuable of any institution in the nation. "

Yes, interdisciplinary learning seems to be the most logical way to learn. It enables the student to relate what is in the classroom to what we find outside the class room. 

"Yes, it allowed me to be exposed to other fields which I'd never have come to on my own, and it gave me a sense of perspective on my primary focus. "

Yes, it allows for easier specialization in many fields and creates a more rounded education. 

Yes, it allows me the freedom to explore topics that otherwise I would not have the opportunity to. 

Yes, it allows me to explore alternative avenues that previously I have not considered. 

Yes, it allows our focus of education to be expanded or narrowed as it needs to be in order to tailor to the professions that we seek after graduation. 

Yes, it eliminates the need for boring prerequisites and instead applies numerous focuses onto your points of interest. 

yes, it gave me the opportunity to develop an educational plan to fit my career goals. 

Yes, it generally answers the question why am I doing this and makes things fit into the world more realistically. 

Yes, it gives a well rounded learning experience 

Yes, it gives context to complex education 

Yes, it gives me a broad perspective for what I will need to accomplish my goals after graduation. 

yes, it gives me a broad range of study instead of just one subject to focus on. 

Yes, It gives me a chance to see how my learning will apply to the outside world. 

Yes, it gives me a well-roundedness, but is hard to explain to others. 

Yes, it gives you an opportunity to focus and view more than one idea. 

Yes, It gives you the opportunity to learn from other disciplines and is more realsitic to actual interaction outside an academic setting. 

"Yes, it has enabled me to learn more than I could have had I had a 'major' "

Yes, it has really helped me to gain knowledge and develop an interest in subjects outside of my focus area. 

Yes, it helps focus students 

Yes, it helps me to understand subjects that are difficult for me by linking them with subjects I can grasp. Also, it opens me up to new subjects. 

Yes, it helps me understand a wider variety of aspects within my chosen field. 

Yes, it helps me understand and some times incorporate other viewpoints. 

Yes, it helps the concept sink in better to approach it in many ways. 

Yes, it highlights connections between subjects that are often unexpected, but are very connected in the world outside academia. It feels like a breath of fresh air to come out of a lifetime of traditional education where every subject is staunchly separate and into a world where I am forced to think about my education in real-world terms, not academic terms. 

Yes, it is a unique but informative learning style that involves the student to actively participate in their own learning. I have obtained and retained so much more information and knowledge in an interdisciplinary setting then in any other learning setting I have been a part of. 

Yes, it is a very constructive and applicable way to learn. 

Yes, it is active learning vs. passive "banking" education (to paraphrase Paulo Freire). 

Yes, it is because its focus is specific and allows for more specialized services. 

Yes, it is extremely important to me. 

Yes, it is importance to study all the relevant areas of a particular topic, because it creates interests and ideas for further studies. 

Yes, it is important to get a variety of studies to find what you really want to know and learn. 

Yes, it is important to me because it allows me to be apart of the learning experience rather then just taking part in a learning experience if that makes sense. 

Yes, it is important to me it introduces me to a new way of learning I gain more knowledge and am able to retain what I learn easier during interdisciplinary learning. 

Yes, it is very important because you get the full picture of the subject you are studying and you gain the ability of interconnectedness. Its like putting a puzzle together you need the border and the middle pieces to make it complete. 

Yes, it is. I enjoy learning from a wide range of subjects, it gives a good "overview" of what\'s pertinent to my choice of studies. 

Yes, it is. I feel like I do well with good direction and just help. I just love learning. 

Yes, it is. The need for more of a variety of program courses inclusive of business and administrative subjects is important. After all, TESC offers an MPA program for Evening and Weekend students. The Winter and Spring quarters are getting worse every year as far as variety and week-night offerings. 

Yes, it makes learning more accessible, meaningful and applicable. 

"Yes, it makes me stay motivated. It's easy to just get and A or B but actually working hard for the perfect evaluation is harder. I love seminar and being able to talk about issues with the class as a whole and hearing other people's opinions. "

Yes, it makes sense. 

Yes, it makes you self driven. Helps to get more into my education. 

Yes, it provides for well rounded education 

yes, it provides the context in which mathematical discoveries are made 

yes, it reflects reality, life in general. 

Yes, it works best for me. 

"Yes, it's awesome. "

"Yes, it's easier to understand everything when it actually relates to other things. "

"Yes, it's fine "

"Yes, it's important it has given my the opportunity to experience a cohesive style of learning. I really enjoyed the team building exercises and the openness of communication between the students. "

"Yes, it's important to see how different separate subjects can integrate with each other, as they do in jobs or other practical (outside academia) matters. On another note, I decided to take mostly courses this quarter due to the LACK of focus on any particular subject within my program; I found although we would circle ideas and actual how-to of writing, we never actually delved into writing itself as a subject matter, or any specific topic for that matter. "

"Yes, it's the way I seem to learn best. "

Yes, keeps me focused. 

Yes, learning out of context is rather useless. 

"Yes, life doesn't happen in discrete pieces. It is great to be a part of a learning discipline that understands that concept. "

"Yes, many traditional students take classes that are related but are never presented to accentuated the connections. I feel that the interdisciplinary learning helps round people's education and leaves less questions as to why certain information is useful. "

Yes, most definitely, Yes. Interdisciplinary learning at this age in my life is what allows me to avoid stagnation in preconceived ideals. Without the challenge of this learning style encouraged by the instructors I have worked with, I would have returned to school and continued to build a base of knowledge cemented with the ideals embedded by my parents and the military, I would have avoided stepping out and opening my mind to listen to the views of others from life styles I have never experienced. I am still amazed at how one communal class experience can open my mind and set a new course of evaluation. I love learning about people and how they each process information and can either interact with others in a positive way or not. The materials used to present class topics is always the newest information and yet history of presentation and information is maintained to keep a perspective of how the change came about and how the future must be ready to adapt for even further advancement. 

Yes, new and different ways of thinking are always beneficial. 

Yes, one of the reasons I came to Evergreen was to experience the interdisciplinary learning available here. My only problem is that sometimes I feel certain parts of a class are a bit of a stretch as far as relating to the whole and might just be included because the teacher enjoys teaching it, not because it is pertinent to the discussion. Generally speaking I really enjoy the perspective given by different areas of study focusing on one topic. 

Yes, people need to be well-rounded. 

Yes, simply because no subject can be limited to a single area, they all connect to each other in some way. 

yes, subjects make more sense when connections are made to other areas 

yes, teaches people to design their own internal set of motavators [sic] and structure for importance of knowledge 

Yes, the more perspectives the more opportunity to learn something new 

Yes, the structure of the learning and the small classes allow for the best possible learning environment. 

Yes, there should be a lot of different choices for students. 

Yes, this I learn what I need to learn. 

Yes, this pedagogy is better for me to learn and enjoy. 

Yes, though I have found it impossible to go in depth into anything until taking upper division. I would appreciate more specific classes in addition to the very multidisciplinary classes we have 

"Yes, to a certain extent. I think it's especially important in the arts to have something to make art about. However I do think the amount of interdisciplinary education should still have a degree of focus to it. "

Yes, to get different perspectives on a topic. 

"Yes, very much so. It recognizes the interconnectedness of the world and its systems.Stduents need to learn how their interests connect to and overlap with the broader view. It's more comprehensive, open, and effective. "

Yes, very much. Subjects are not segregated in the real world. 

Yes, very. It is the most sound way to understand an idea or issue. 

yes, we all need a rounded education 

Yes, when it is a solid well planned program it is amazing. 

yes, whole systems thinking is a must 

"Yes, without it I don't learn. "

Yes, you see how many different studies fit togther in the real world. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. Because nothing exists independently, so framing our learning in a way that values the reality that things are interconnected will have a positive and practical influence on the way we think about our lives and approach problem-solving. 

Yes. I feel that interdisciplinary learning helps to effectively integrate the things I learn in college into my real-life career choices in the future. 

yes. I have always gone to liberal arts schools. I like to see how everything is connected and can be applied to change in the world 

Yes. I would be bored without being able to see the connectedness and learn on many different levels. 

Yes. Interdisciplinary learning allows for different learning styles and allows students to learn from each other in a more meaningful fashion. 

Yes. Interdisciplinary learning is essential, as everything is connected. The world is not structured in the same segregated block fashion as traditional education, so we might as well ditch that idea. Beyond interdisciplinary education being important, experiential education is important. As students, we need to be able to connect what we are learning with our lives, on a personal level, and with our greater world and community. 

Yes. It allows me to integrate different areas of science, which is important when conducting research 

Yes. It helps me to feel more connected to the school environment while also keeping me from losing interest in the material at hand, which used to be a problem for me in high school when I often couldn\'t "see what this has to do with anything." 

"Yes. It's a valuable skill to be able to learn the connections between subjects as you are studying them. "

Yes. That is why I chose Evergreen. I want a well rounded education. 

Yes. There is a lot to learn from one class that is based on more than one subject. 

Yes. After graduation I need to have an education that has truly taught my something. interdisciplinary learning supports this. 

Yes. Because I never truly know exactly what I want to learn. By combining subjects, I am given the exposure and flexibility to explore new topics and arenas of learning - not to mention, the ability to critically compare different academic approaches, with others, and under guidance of a professor. 

Yes. Bridges learning into a cohesive whole 

Yes. Broadens learning experience 

"Yes. I am paying 25,000 dollars out of state tuition so that I can learn this way. It's important to integrate subject matter to get an overalll experience. It makes school applicable to everyday experiences. "

Yes. I appreciate being able to study in multiple disciplines because I gain a greater understanding of the world. I also have many interests, so an interdisciplinary curriculum allows me opportunities to pursue a variety of paths. 

Yes. I believe that all parts of life inform each other. 

"Yes. I can make connections between what I'm learning and its application in the real world. "

Yes. I can only compare full-time/daytime 16 credits to full-time/day-time 16 credits from unrelated classes. Issues are connected, so we can explore a few themes deeply with the same core faculty and students through the program instead of unrelated classes that might stretch me in different directions. Interdiscplinary provides a more enriching education environment. 

"Yes. I don't want to be limited to one discipline or one way of thinking about a problem when I'm in a program. I want to be able to approach a problem from many different angles. "

Yes. I feel it is one of the most beneficial ways of learning. 

Yes. I feel like instead of having two teachers to teach one class that you should let each teacher teach their own class. 

Yes. I feel that interdisciplinary learning is essential to the Evergreen experience, the liberal arts experience, and in fact is the best means of preparing a student for the "real world." In a working environment, a person is expected to manage different types of tasks, thinking and working accross subject borders. Therefore, interdisciplinary learning provides relevant and necessary skills for any future career. 

Yes. I learn better and with more clarity in an environment where relevance is emphasized by the program in order to apply what I learn to life. 

"Yes. I like being able to learn things through an avenue I never would have thought about, or see the things I'm interested in through another viewpoint. "

Yes. I think it is a key part of well-rounded learning. 

Yes. Interdisciplinary learning is congruement [sic] to the world that surrounds us, and is appropriate. 

Yes. Interdisciplinary learning is the best way for me to learn. 

Yes. Interdisciplinary learning makes useful connections between subjects and gives a context to better understand the material. This is much better than when subjects are separated from each other, as they are then taught with much less applicability. Individual subjects become unimportant in my eyes and are quickly forgotten. 

"Yes. It allows me to make my own connections between what I have already identified as an 'area of interest' specifically to me, and with what ever other connections exist between that field and others. For example, I have been able to study Globalization in a contemporary political and cultural context regarding India especially, and a historical context through studying the Age of Sail. "

"Yes. It allows me to recieve a more thorough education of my chosen field. I don't have to waste time or money learning about something that will have nothing to do with my job. "

Yes. It gives me a more hands-on approach to learning and this makes it easier to learn for me. 

"Yes. It gives one the opportunity to learn more by listening to other's point of view and for facts. "

Yes. It gives students a wide variety of knowledge, and the adaptability that comes with this variety is very valuable in the working world. 

Yes. It helped me discover what I really want to study, what my interests are, and how other disciplines work that I would not have otherwise had much discourse with. 

"Yes. It helps me really understand what I am focusing on learning. It gives me different perspectives on a subject and keeps me interested and excited about whatever I'm learning. "

Yes. It helps to connect important concepts in the sciences. 

Yes. It is a nice altenative to traditional learning. It gives me a feeling of rounded out-ness in my education. 

Yes. It offers a broader range of experience. 

Yes. It presents a broader spectrum for experience, rather than students rushing through pre-requisite classes. 

"Yes. I've found these mixed classes to be an exceptional way of learning not only whatever the core focus of the class is, but how it affects the world at large. This focus has been present in all classes I've taken. Even the smaller 4 credit classes are imbued with a sense of needing to provide multiple disciplines into the subject. That said, there HAVE to be more 4 and 8 credit classes made available. There needs to not only be more of these classes in the evening but there really should be smaller classes provided during the day as well. The huge 16 credit courses are simply not possible for returning students to commit to. From my observations and anecdotal evidence from staff, graduates and other students, the people who get the most from Evergreen are the older students who are returning to school, and not the 18 and 19 year olds. There is a large adult student community and while we may be able to find a day or two a week to come to class during regular business hours, we certainly cannot manage the 16 credit courses that are the only options for far too many fields of study. "

Yes. Life is interdisciplinary! 

Yes. The ability to view a topic from multiple perspectives not only gives that subject dimension, but also provides an integral approach to problem solving in any field. 

Yes. The interdisciplinary learning in new to me, but interesting. 

Yes. The notion of studying subjects in a sterile environment is not conducive to reality. 

Yes. The study of business and economics at most schools does not help you transfer that education into the real world. The programs at Evergreen work to build foundations relating that book work to the real world in seminar and outside projects. 

Yes. The world is more visably interconnected. We understand the benefit of diversity of thought and how that brings strength to a project of any type. I am confident that I can be useful to any team because of my ability to draw connections from a variety of diciplines. 

Yes. We need connections between the sciences, social and otherwise. 

"yes: activities we do in the world, jobs we have, and the way we interact with people are all interdisciplinary. you cannot act on one study area in the world as you can in the classroom. i therefore think it's very important to learn in an interdisciplinary way as well so that you can more easily apply your learning to the world. "

Yes; it brings much more focus to education plus provides a vehicle that connects all the different aspects of what we have learned together. 

"Yes; it's a whole approach to learning a subject - makes it more interesting, not so close-mi
